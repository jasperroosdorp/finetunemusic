  ## Project

  In collaboration with director Joshua Maldonado we produced the music video ‘White Wolf’. The white wolf and the black wolf symbolize the good and evil side of mankind. With this duality in mind, we created both the visuals and the music.

  ## Audio

  Fine Tune Music produced the music, supervised by Marcel Davids. The lyrics and vocals were created together with singer/songwriter Migloko from Lithuania.
