  ## Project

  We will do anything to appear authentic. We watch reality TV, featuring real people, and on Facebook we present ourselves as unique personalities because being authentic is what it is all about. We think we are completely free in doing so, but are we? Can we still call it authenticity if everybody is trying for the same thing? ‘Wat wil je nou?’ (‘What is it you want?’) uses film, interviews and essays to explore an obsession with one of the emptiest concepts of today: Authenticity. The film was nominated for best Groninger Film 2016 and the Noordelijke Filmfestival in Leeuwarden was one of the many events where it was presented. Watch the complete film on the <a href="http://www.watwiljenou.nl" target="_blank">website</a>.

  ## Audio

  David produced the music for the documentary and trailer of this film. For the composition of the unconventional soundtrack he used strict rules: He opted, for instance, for using one single musical theme throughout the film, based on the intro of Igor Stravinsky’s “Le Sacre Du Printemps”. He used a piano as a percussion instrument, as a way of creating a unique and bold sound.
