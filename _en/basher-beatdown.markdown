  ## Project

  Basher Beatdown is a multiplayer game, developed by Sword GC. The game is available on Air Console, and will be released soon on Steam.

  ## Audio

  For this game we let the high energy and brutal impact of the gameplay inspire us to produce five electronic music tracks for the menu and levels. We created more than 130 sound effects, and recorded a voice actor to give the characters featuring in this game, a personality of their own.
