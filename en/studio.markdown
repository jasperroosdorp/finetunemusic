  # Studio

  You will feel comfortable and at home in our studio. It is a multifunctional workspace with state-of-the-art equipment and multiple recording rooms. We offer entire band recordings, but we provide for smaller recording sessions as well. It will be our pleasure to take care of the mixing of your music and to offer advice concerning music production as such. We can help you work out your compositions and find the right sound for your songs. Whether itâ€™s cinematic arrangements, soulful RnB-productions or experimental beats, versatility is one of our qualities.
