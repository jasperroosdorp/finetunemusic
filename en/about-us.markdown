    an extraordinary fascination for music and sound. Curiosity is one of his driving
    forces when creating unique compositions, for which his background as a classical
    pianist is of great value. A keen ear for detail can be heard in his music, for
    example in the rich, detailed mixes he produces for various music styles. \n\nDavid
    is an enterprising visionary and loves challenges, varying from big commercial
    projects to experimental collaborations with other artists. As a musical jack-of-all-trades
    and using several egos, he releases all kinds of music: from heavy electronic
    music and dark soul to dynamic classical music.\n\nBeing David, he knows how to
    convey emotions in music and sound. He uses this effectively as a communication
    tool when turning identity into sound and taking the listener on a journey. David
    worked with, among other parties, Bert Visscher, Club Guy and Roni and Van Engelenburg
    Theaterproducties.\n\nDavid's [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/finetunemusic/)"

    ## Paul Maaswinkel

    Paul’s wide background makes him feel at home with a great range of styles. His work as a songwriter and producer varies from writing catchy pop songs to making bold, dirty beats, in which distinct grooves always stand out.

    Paul is a skilled arranger and knows how to give instruments their own space in orchestral cinematic scores, swinging jazz harmonies, as well as in compact song structures. He refined this craft, writing vocal arrangements, which have won him several international awards.

    In recent years he composed and produced music for a great number of theatre plays as in-house composer for Theater Young Ones. Here he developed a keen sense for telling stories through music, in a way that really moves the listener. This is also reflected in Paul’s enthusiastic way of communicating with other artists, both in and outside the studio. Typhoon, Akwasi and The Cool Quest are among the artists he worked with.
