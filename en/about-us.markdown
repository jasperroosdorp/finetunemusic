  ## David Marcel de Jong

  From his early childhood, David has had an extraordinary fascination for music and sound. Curiosity is one of his driving forces when creating unique compositions, for which his background as a classical pianist is of great value. A keen ear for detail can be heard in his music, for example in the rich, detailed mixes he produces for various music styles.

  David is an enterprising visionary and loves challenges, varying from big commercial projects to experimental collaborations with other artists. As a musical jack-of-all-trades and using several egos, he releases all kinds of music: from heavy electronic music and dark soul to dynamic classical music.

  Being David, he knows how to convey emotions in music and sound. He uses this effectively as a communication tool when turning identity into sound and taking the listener on a journey.
