introduction:
- |-
  We’re the first songbird in the morning.
  The sound of rain after drought.
  The echo in the mountains.
- |-
  You will find us everywhere, but we are always invisible.
  We travel at tremendous speed.
- |-
  We can scare you, make you laugh and make you cry.
  We’re that melody that will just not leave your mind,
  but also that one song you no longer remember the name to.
