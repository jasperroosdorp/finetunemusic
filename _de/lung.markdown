summary: Industrial designer Han Koning crafted this artificial ‘long’, an installation
  that calls up the idea of an organic creature, in an alienating way. This project
  was directed by Joshua Maldonado.
audio: The calm, almost hypnotic movement of the lung inspired us in producing the
  music for this video. By combining both organic and artificial elements, we created
  a unique sound identity, matching the over-all audio house style we developed for
  Han Koning.
